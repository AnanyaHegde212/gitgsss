The difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree

Meary Tree

A general tree structure where each node can have at most two children (left and right).

Nodes can be arranged in any order.

Can have duplicate values.

Searching, insertion, and deletion can be slow (worst case O(n) time).

macy Search Tree (BST):

A specific type of binary tree with a sorting rule.

Left child's value is ALWAYS less than the parent node's value.

Right child's value is ALWAYS greater than the parent node's value.

No duplicate values allowed.

Enables fast searching, insertion, and deletion
